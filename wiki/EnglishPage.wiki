= Adblock Plus filters list for Vietnam =

An Adblock Plus filters list which is supplemental to !EasyList and !EasyElement to help block advertisements on websites from Vietnam. Use the link "Adblock Plus - Bộ lọc Việt Nam" on the right side of the project's homepage to subscribe to this list.

*NOTE: This is just a supplemental list to !EasyList, you should use it with !EasyList to achieve best results.*

==More Info==
  * *Adblock Plus*: an extension for Firefox, helps blocking advertisements on websites. *Moreover, the blocked ads are not downloaded, and that makes pages load faster for dial-up users in Vietnam.* Download at https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1865

  * *!EasyList,!EasyElement*: global filter lists for Adblock Plus. *Adblock _Pro_ of IE uses a ripped version of these filter lists* [[http://adblockplus.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3062&sid=84f60f42e73c6fda49f512f138558a8a 1]]. If you haven't subsribed to !Easy yet, just get into here http://easylist.adblockplus.org, and click "Add to ABP".

  * You only need to subscribe to a list once, then Adblock Plus will auto update it when there are new changes later. You won't have to manually add your own filters.

  * If there are false positives, or if you have filter suggestions, just notify us. When we update the list, not only you but everyone will benefit from it :)
