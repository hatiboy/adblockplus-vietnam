*NOTE: This is just a supplemental list to EasyList, you should use it with EasyList to achieve best results.*

==More Info==
  * *Adblock Plus*: an extension for Firefox, helps blocking advertisements on websites. *Moreover, the blocked ads are not downloaded, and that makes pages load faster for dial-up users in Vietnam.* Download at https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1865

  * You only need to subscribe to a list once, then Adblock Plus will auto update it when there are new changes later. You won't have to manually add your own filters.

  * If there are false positives, or if you have filter suggestions, just notify us. When we update the list, not only you but everyone will benefit from it :)
