= Adblock Plus - Vietnam List =
An Adblock Plus filters list which is supplemental to !EasyList and !EasyElement to help block advertisements on websites from Vietnam. *Ads were yesterday... in Vietnam!* 

*NOTE: This is just a supplemental list to !EasyList, you should use it with !EasyList to achieve best results.*

==More Info==
  * *Adblock Plus*: an extension for Firefox, helps blocking advertisements on websites. *Moreover, the blocked ads are not downloaded, and that makes pages load faster for dial-up users in Vietnam.* Download at https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1865

  * *!EasyList, !EasyElement*: global filters lists for Adblock Plus. *Adblock Pro for Internet Explorer (IE) uses a ripped version of these filters lists* [http://adblockplus.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3062&sid=84f60f42e73c6fda49f512f138558a8a [1]]. If you haven't subsribed to the Easy lists yet, just get into here http://easylist.adblockplus.org, and add them.

  * You only need to subscribe to a list once, then Adblock Plus will auto update it when there are new changes later. You won't have to manually add your own filters.

  * If there are false positives, or if you have filters suggestions, just notify us. When we update the list, not only you but everyone will benefit from it :)
